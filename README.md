# Lymphoma-VTE risk-model

- The lymphoma-specific models to estimate venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (LE-DVT) risk based on clinical features was developed in 10,310 patients and subsequently validated in 2 independent populations with 854 and 1,858 patients. The final Fine and Gray competing risk models incorporating these 7 covariates had a derivation c-statistic of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.67-0.69) for overall VTE and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.66-0.71) for PE/LE-DVT. In the HHS validation, the c-statistics were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64-0.79) for overall VTE and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.65-0.79) for PE/LE-DVT. In the MDACC cohort, the c-statistics were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.75) for overall VTE and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63-0.73) for PE/LE-DVT.


- We have developed an innovative online calculator for our predictive model, which is accessible at: https://dynamicapp.shinyapps.io/VTE_risk_in_lymphoma/. This tool is specifically designed to enable personalized predictions of the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pulmonary embolism/lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (PE/LE-DVT) for lymphoma patients. It offers the unique capability to assess these risks at any time point within the first year following systemic treatment, providing clinicians and patients with valuable, tailored risk assessments to aid in treatment planning and management.

  
- To facilitate predictions for a specific patient dataset, you can prepare your lymphoma data in the format of "sample_data.csv". For guidance on structuring your dataset, please refer to the "Data dictionary.xlsx", which serves as a comprehensive reference. Once your data is formatted correctly, you can seamlessly validate the models using the script provided in the "github_model.R" file. This streamlined process ensures that you can efficiently apply our predictive models to your unique dataset for accurate and insightful analyses.

- The sample dataset is completely made up.
