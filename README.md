# Lymphoma-VTE-model

- The lymphoma-specific models to estimate venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (LE-DVT) risk based on clinical features was developed in 10,310 patients and subsequently validated in 2 independent populations with 854 and 1,858 patients. The final Fine and Gray competing risk models incorporating these 7 covariates had a derivation c-statistic of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.67-0.69) for overall VTE and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.66-0.71) for PE/LE-DVT. In the HHS validation, the c-statistics were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64-0.79) for overall VTE and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.65-0.79) for PE/LE-DVT. In the MDACC cohort, the c-statistics were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.75) for overall VTE and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63-0.73) for PE/LE-DVT.


- If you would prepare your lymphoma dataset as “sample_data.csv” with “Data dictionary.xlsx” as a reference, you could easily validate the models using the code in “github_model.R” file.

- The sample dataset is completely made up.
